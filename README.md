# ECE-550-catkin_ws

These were the coding homework assignments in ROS for ECE 550 @ UIUC. There are 3 assignments you'll find in the 'src' folder
1. Basic ROS Publisher and Subscriber to move turtle sim to a goal position using P control?
1. Using artificial potential fields to navigate a robot from a starting point to an end point and avoid obstacles
1. Using a crude RRT algorithm to plan an arm from one position to another. Didn't fully work.
